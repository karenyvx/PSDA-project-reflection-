While completing the challenging group project 2 of Probability & Statistical Data Analysis (PSDA), I have learned lots of useful knowledge and gained valuable teamwork experience while working in a group. In the progress, we struggling to figure out the suitable data set for our project as it is significance for us in order to get the ideal results. One of the challenges is that we could not get the ideal scatter plot result for the regression test, and after consult with our lecturer, we found that we chose the inappropriate variable in conducting our test. 
The statistical tests we conducted, including correlation analysis, regression analysis, and ANOVA, provided a deeper understanding for me to learn to. 
On the other hand, I have learned a lot about the R programming. I strongly believe that through this project, I would make a fundamental in R programming which would benefit me in the future. 
In addition, there is a hypothesis 2 sample test, correlation test, regression test, and ANOVA test needed to perform data analysis in this project. This is a great chance for me to revise back what I have learned in class. Lastly, I would like to express my gratitude to my lecturer, Dr. Sharin Hazlin Huspi, for the unconditional support and guidance throughout this project. i truly appreciate your guidance, patience and the valuable feedback you provided at each stage of this project.
